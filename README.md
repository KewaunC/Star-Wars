## How It's Made: 

**Tech used:** HTML, JS, Star Wars API

I wanted to dabble a bit into APIs and how they worked and how to pull data from them. I love anything and everything Star Wars so when I had seen this I had desfintaly wanted to play around with it

## Optimizations

I could've picked a better API for starters. However looking back I realize that this is my first ever API and the API I had found was as robust as later ones so I'm defintaely glad this was my first one and I was able to get my brain thinking and "ny feet wet"

## Lessons Learned:

Not all APIs are super in depth and not all APIs are good ones. However sometimes you have to play around with what you're givena nd just see what you can do with it! I definately want to revisit this project and just see what else I could do with it
